To successfully run the emulator requires:

	* Unsigned wrapping 16 bit cells (0-65565).
	
	* A tape of at least 131193 cells.
	  At the beginning of execution the tape head is assumed to be in the leftmost cell
	  and will move ony to cells on its right.
	  
	* The compiler used fro testing on an input ("," comand) will read a sring from console until
      user presses enter. The string is returned with a terminating $0D char.

	  For example, whn the code contains a "," execution stops waiting for user input.
	  Users enters "A1!" followed by "enter" key.
	  BrainFuck will receive the characters with decimal ASCII code: 65, 49, 33, 10 in this sequence.
	  
	  Notice this has implications in using the C libraries. The code in read.s reads input
	  until a $00 or $A0 character is returned; if $00 ir read, it is replaced by $A0 before returning
	  from C call.
