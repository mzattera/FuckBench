Please note that these example programs might not use all of the features of the FBF language because some of them are written for older versions of FBF and I have just made the necessary changes so that they run on the latest FBF version. Some of them might became much more readable and smaller if rewritten from the scratch for the latest version. These programs are included for demonstration purposes. To learn how to program in FBF read the documentation and the tutorial.
