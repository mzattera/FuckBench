This is the Esotope Brainfuck Compiler: the world's most optimizing Brainfuck-
to-something compiler. Well, it is not a Something-to-Brainfuck compiler like
Jeffry Johnston's BFBASIC, but it translates the Brainfuck code into efficient
target language code (and possibly human-readable), so in this sense it is
actually a _decompiler_ rather than compiler.

There are many Brainfuck-to-C compilers (or Brainfuck-to-ELF compiler, and so
on) available, but there are almost no compiler which can translate the
following Brainfuck code:

    >+++++++++[<++++++++>-]<.>+++++++[<++++>-]<+.+++++++..+++.>>>++++++++[
    <++++>-]<.>>>++++++++++[<+++++++++>-]<---.<<<<.+++.------.--------.>>+.

...into something like the following code:

    /* generated by esotope-bfc */
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdint.h>
    #define PUTS(s) fwrite(s, 1, sizeof(s)-1, stdout)
    static uint8_t m[30000], *p = m;
    int main(void) {
        PUTS("Hello World!");
        return 0;
    }

Surprisingly I had seen no compiler reached this one! So I started to make my
own compiler; Esotope Brainfuck Compiler is the result. (Actually, there are
now one or two other compilers reached this state, but they are inspired by
Esotope Brainfuck Compiler.)

                                   HOW TO USE
                                   ==========

Esotope Brainfuck Compiler requires Python 2.5 or later. Optionally you can
use Psyco JIT compiler for better performance; Psyco is certainly required for
very large Brainfuck code, including Jon Ripley's The Lost Kingdom.

Use "esotope-bfc" Python script to invoke Esotope Brainfuck Compiler. It can
read the code from the given file, or standard input ("-"):

    $ ./esotope-bfc -
    +[]
    ^D
    /* generated by esotope-bfc */
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdint.h>
    static uint8_t m[30000], *p = m;
    int main(void) {
        while (1); /* infinite loop */
    }
