The files in this folder are Klaus Dormann's 6502 [tests](https://github.com/amb5l/6502_65C02_functional_tests), 
edited to build correctly using cc65's assembler and linker for Windows.

These are funtional tests to ensure the 6502bf emulator is working properly.

`bin\FB_build_6502test.bat` can be used to (re)build and execute the tests.
