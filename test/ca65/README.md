The files in this folder are Klaus Dormann's 6502 [tests](https://github.com/amb5l/6502_65C02_functional_tests), edited to build correctly using cc65's assembler and linker for Windows.

These are funtional tests to ensure the 6502bf emulator is working properly. Tests are written in 6502 assembler with ca65 (cc65 assembler) syntax.

build.bat can be used to (re)build the tests.
