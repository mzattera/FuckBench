Code for building and testing single examples or entire release

Downgrade to Java 8? Update README.md accordingly

Put Python under redistr? Maybe use https://www.jython.org (needs Java 8) will simplify batch files

put cc65 ZIP in redistr?

Diagram to show compilation process for several languages.

flag for test runner for verbose mode (show compilation output)



>>>> CHECK IN <<<<<<<



Code to test unknown opcodes.



Code to time execution of programs



SHR & SHL (?)

BRK loop detection

Usage of P in addressing mode, maybe we can replace using a tmp variable and just increment P

IF...THEN...ELSE (remove set exception 0)



Improved macros for read() & write().

Code to test all macros.

Code to test read() (?) e write() e interrupt from C & ASM?.



Bitwise functions clear workarea; do it effciently (clear the minimum required in BF directly) 

Check FBF code for accessing tables, maybe it's not super efficient?



Example for ASM & C (chess? adventure? hunt the wumpus? something recursive?)

Separate emu compile batch that automatically switches on or off checks for loops or have 2 version of compiler one w. check disabled and batch files can choose which to use.
