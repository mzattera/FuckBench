umpus to the BF code colection


SET LOCAL

SHR (?)

remove #dim _mf_c0 _mf_c1 _mf_c2 _mf_c3

Bitwise functions clear workarea; do it effciently (clear the minimum required in BF directly) 
-> Hint isolate the brainfuck code for each function in the C code, replace acces to m[] with functions to track which cell is accessed.
-> replace clean_tape with required [-]>

is mod X 255 faster than AND X 255? -> check similar stuff.

Move time libraries from C to ASM (there are examples in libsrc)

test\c\timetest.c non funziona se cambi CLOCKS_SEC



Diagram to show compilation process for several languages.



Example for ASM & C & Java (chess? adventure? hunt the wumpus? something recursive?)

Separate emu compile batch that automatically switches on or off checks for loops or have 2 version of compiler one w. check disabled and batch files can choose which to use.





Can we move b2fJ to Java 15 removing dependency on 1.8?
