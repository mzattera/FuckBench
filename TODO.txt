After you found fastest emu between V3 and V4, remove the one you use from archive


Migrate to latest cc65 that solve CLOCK_TICKS issue.



First working FB_java.bat

b2jf should be able to take a .jar and its main class (or a runnable jar) as input and link it...now it works with a single file
how to setup Eclipse so you can develop a whole java project (using correct java version and lang classes).

Downgrade to Java 8? Update README.md accordingly

Put Python under redistr? Maybe use https://www.jython.org (needs Java 8) will simplify batch files

Batch to auto rebuild Java tools



SHR (?)

if V3 is chosen remove set exception 0 and all check blocks -> check how SYSCALL sets this in V3

SET LOCAL

Bitwise functions clear workarea; do it effciently (clear the minimum required in BF directly) 

is mod X 255 faster than AND X 255? -> check similar stuff.

Move time libraries from C to ASM (there are examples in libsrc)



Diagram to show compilation process for several languages.


Example for ASM & C & Java (chess? adventure? hunt the wumpus? something recursive?)

Separate emu compile batch that automatically switches on or off checks for loops or have 2 version of compiler one w. check disabled and batch files can choose which to use.


FB_java.bat uses a workaround that fixes issues with cc65 and spaces in path; maybe we can use same approach in FB_cl?
If this is possible, we can then use the cc65 redistributed with b2fj instead of having to install it
have FB_Java.bat to use loop instead compiling files one by one, maybe linker can use *.o; if so, update b2fJ as well.

Remove FB_cc?

implemnet BCD mode?

Can we move b2fJ to Java 15 removing dependency on 1.8?
