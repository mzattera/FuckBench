# FuckBench

## What is it?

FuckBench (*FB*) is a set of batch files and tools to comiple from several languages into (BrainFuck)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck] (*BF*). 

In addition to creating BF code, FB creates higly optimized C files using the
(Esotope)[https://github.com/lifthrasiir/esotope-bfc] BF to C compiler.
If a C compiler is configured, a Windows executable is also created.

Currently, it supports comipiling the following languages to BF:
 * ANSI C (no float support)
 * 6502 Assembler
 
## How does it work?
 
FB contains an emulator of the 6502 CPU (`6502.fbf`); this allows using cross-comiplers available for the 6502 CPU to create BF code.
A "linker" is provided (`CodeMerge.jar`) to "link" 6502 executable code to the emulator, creating a single BF file that can then be executed
by using any available BF compiler or interpreter.

Given the generated code is not the fastest, I stringly suggest to configure a C compiler, as explained below, 
such that C code generated by Esotope can be turned into a Windows executable.
 
 ## Usage
 
 ### Prerequisites
 
 FB relies on a set of tools that need to be installed, as described below.
 
 #### Configuration
 
 Download latest BF release and unzip it in a folder on your machine. We will refer to this folder as `<root>`.
 
  1. Edit `<root>\bin\config.bat` set FB_HOME to `<root>`.
  2. I stringly suggest to
