# FuckBench

## What is it?

FuckBench (*FB*) is a set of batch files and tools to compile from several languages into [BrainFuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) (*BF*). 

Optionally, in addition to creating BF code, FB compiled generated BF code into 
higly optimized C files using the [Esotope](https://github.com/lifthrasiir/esotope-bfc) BF to C compiler.
If a C compiler is configured, a Windows executable is also created.

Currently, FB supports compiling the following languages to BF:
 * ANSI C (no float support)
 * 6502 Assembler
 * FuckBrainFuck(http://www.inshame.com/search/label/My%20Progs%3A%20FuckBrainfuck)
 
## How does it work?
 
FB includes a BF emulator for the 6502 CPU (`6502.fbf`); this allows using cross-comiplers available for the 6502 CPU to create BF code.
A "linker" is provided (`CodeMerge.jar`) to "link" 6502 executable code to the emulator, creating a single BF file that can then be executed
by using any available BF compiler or interpreter.

Given the generated code is not the fastest, I strongly suggest to configure a C compiler, as explained below, 
such that C code generated by Esotope can be turned into a Windows executable.
 
## Usage
  
### Configuration

Download latest BF release and unzip it in a folder on your machine. We will refer to this folder as `<root>`.

FB relies on a set of external tools. Some of them need to be installed, as described below.
Others are made available under the `<root>\redistr` folder, for your convenience.
 
  1. I strongly suggest to add `<root>\bin` to your path such that FB tools can be invoked from any tool in your folder.
     The below examples assume batch files in the `<root>\bin` folder are accessible from the current location in the CLI.
  2. Install [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
     FB needs Java 15 or later.
  
Optional; the below steps are required if you want to compile generated BF code into C.
If you skip the below configuration, BF compilation will stop after genereating BF code.

  3. Install [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  4. Edit `<root>\bin\config.bat` and set FB_PYTHON to the Python interpreter executable. 
  
Optional; the below steps are required if you want to compile C code generated above into a Windows executable.

  5. Edit `<root>\bin\config.bat` and set FB_ESOTOPE to `esotope-bfc` file inside Esotope folder. 

### Compiling BrainFuck code

If you followed the above optional steps, you can invoke:

```
FB_bf f
```

To compile BrainFuck `f.bf` source file into `f.c` C code and corresponding executable Windows file `f.exe`.

Again, if Python or C compilers have not been configured, compilation will stop to some intermediate steps.

### Compiling FuckBrainFuck code

You can invoke:

```
FB_fbf f
```

To compile FuckBrainFuck `f.fbf` source file into `f.bf` BrainFuck code, `f.c` C code and corresponding executable Windows file `f.exe`.

Again, if Python or C compilers have not been configured, compilation will stop to some intermediate steps.
